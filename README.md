# Crawling MedPix Database
[MedPixÂ®](https://medpix.nlm.nih.gov/home) is a free open-access online database of medical images, teaching cases, and clinical topics, integrating images and textual metadata including over 12,000 patient case scenarios, 9,000 topics, and nearly 59,000 images. In this project, I tried to crawl data from this rich database and collect some valuable images and related metadata. Data is categorized based on the image Plane. Here is the list of Planes that I considered crawling data from them:
- AP
- Axial
- Coronal
- Frontal
- Histology
- Image-Plane
- Lateral
- Longitudinal
- Mammo-CC
- Mammo-MagCC
- Mammo-MLO
- Multiple-or-Montage
- NOS
- Oblique
- Other view
- PA
- 3D-Reconstruction
- Transverse
- Sagittal
- Decubitus
Overall, I collected 21247 images from the database and related data about them such as title, caption, modality, demographics, topic, disease discussion, location, and category.
